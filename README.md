# Health Data Science - UoE - Final RMarkdown Assignment

## About
Final assignment of online, Health Data Science course facilitated by University of Edinburgh. 
This project uses public health data from NHS services around Scotland. The assignment was to
wrangle, tidy and visualise three datasets. This joining of the datasets was in an effort to
determine patterns and trends within the data, which was primarily admission and mortality data
gathered from NHS services around Scotland. 

## Instructions
There is a pdf which will showcase the final graphs towards the bottom of the document.

The markdown files have been included to which the corresponding R code for the graphs
can be seen. 

## Final Notes & Ideas 
I am always keen to discuss how technologies can be used for social good - I'm constantly
researching into new organisations that will utilise software engineering and data science
for the benefit of people. Please feel free to get in touch if you have
any questions or would like to discuss anything - my LinkedIn can be found in my GitHub profile.

I will be using https://quarto.org/ in the future to regularly update my development plus 
discoveries within data science.
